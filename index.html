    <h3>Hello, Garrett</h3>
    <h5>August 22, 2025</h5>

    <p>I never really expect a connection towards you pero it just hit eh hahwha. Siguro we were meant to meet kasi first day na katabi kita we just clicked, I was comfortable to tell you stories and I was open attentively to listen to yours.</p>

    <p>Kahit na I did not receive a postive comment about you before tayo maging seatmates kasi diba inis nga sayo si ano HAHAHAHA pero besides their negative feedback about you kasi "nag ccheat" ka raw. I somehow still saw the good in you. (hindi naman negative yon sakin kasi gawain ko rin sometimes hehe) And eventually I found myself looking at you genuinely and <span class="highlight">I care about you in every way possible</span>.</p>

    <p>I was always scared on telling you how I feel but I was never scared to show you that I care, idk how to say it haha pero when I saw the spark in your eyes it made me realize you are a great person and it also made me realize that I am falling, I'm trying my best not to, kasi bestfriend kita and I don't want to lose that pero day by day, moment ny moment I just can't help it. Everytime u make me laugh, everytime u joke around I get reminded on how I feel. Being your friend is indeed a blessing.</p>

    <p>Meeting you was like me finding the other end of my red string. my ride or die, my number 1, and <span class="highlight">poetically the matcha to my coffee</span>. I lifetimely believed I would never find someone like you, I mean with all the treatment I received from my past, the history with my parents, love has been always a tragedy. I accepted that I'd be better off alone, that I can stand on my own, that I would never need anyone to hold me after a tiring day. But you proved me wrong, you are <span class="highlight">indeed the only exception</span>. You have been always the friend I state my feelings with.</p>

    <p>I want you to remember that when things get too heavy for you, andito ako para tulungan at pakinggan ka â€”palagi. I have so soooo much love in me, and you're already receiving alot of it as my friend, what more as your lover.</p>

    <p>I'd surely give up forever to be with you. I'm willing to risk everything, I'm not a fan of promises but I assure you, as long as I'm here you will always have someone. Someone who will stay with you on your zero days, Someone who will guide you on every step you're having a hard time with, Someone who's willing to spend their forever to be with you, Someone who would repeatedly mention you in their prayers.</p>

    <p class="centered">I will always be that someone for you :)</p>
